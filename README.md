#PHP Best Practices
A list of best practices tips for better PHP

## INTRODUCTION

Over the years PHP developers have often received very bad reputation mainly due to poor coding and not escaping SQL from injection.

One way to improve the over-all quality of a product, help reduce problems, increase productivity and development and generally make life a little easier in the long run is to stick to a set of Coding Standards as closely as possible.

All projects should take the same approach, and stick to one set of coding standards, as this will solve many common problems, in particular projects which have more than one developer.

There's lots of well established Coding Standards out there. One such is [PEAR Coding Standards](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php). PEAR is a library of useful classes for PHP, as an attempt to help users from re-inventing the wheel to achieve the same task. PEAR has grown larger over the years and has many packages on offer, as such like everyone else some packages in PEAR had common problems. The PEAR team decided it was best to employ coding standards for everyone to work to.

PHP best practices are different, as although you do not have to follow them, some of the suggestions are worth taking note of and will save you headaches in the long run.
